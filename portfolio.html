            <p>My name is Brian Lipsett. I am from Newmarket, NH and am currently pursuing a career in web development. After high school I attended Lakes Region Community College in 
                Laconia, NH. During my first year of the Business Management 
                program I began work at Blakes Restaurant in Manchester.
                3 years into my career in hospitality I decided I needed a change and 
                enlisted into the New Hampshire Air National Guard. Over the past 6 years 
                I have dedicated all my time and effort into the Guard and USAF. Visiting multiple 
                countries and various us locations the temporary duty assignments and deployments I learned
                of my passion for travel and making the most of only a few hours in a new foreign city.
